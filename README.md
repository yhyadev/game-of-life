# Conway's Game Of Life

Also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input

## Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## The Idea of This Repository

This repository is just an archive of different implementations of Game Of Life in different programming languages
